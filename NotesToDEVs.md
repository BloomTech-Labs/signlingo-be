**Introduction**

This project has been a lot of fun building from the ground up and it is our
sincerest hope that the future DEVs that work on this project that they have as
much fun as we did. The purpose of this file is to allow future DEVs working on
this project to send a message to then next Cohort of DEVs and explain what they
were working on and their goals at the time. It is hoped that you the current
DEVs working on this project will continue to add to this file for future DEVs
to read and keep eventually add their remarks.

From David Isakson: I have had a blast with this project and I hope that you do
to. As I am sure you will find out, if you haven't already, that I used a boilerplate
to generate the base code from which the Backend is built upon. In several of the
files you will find a shameless plug for this boilerplate. While you are under no
obligation I ask that you keep this shameless plug intact as well as the plug for
Seth and I in the files that we developed while building this project.

The boilerplate was created by myself and was heavily influence by the code I learned
during the regular curriculum. But the future version of this tool will contain
improvements that were inspired by the development of this project. All of the
code that Seth and I worked on should be commented fairly well so as to avoid
confusion as to what the code is doing.
